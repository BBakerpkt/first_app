# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) 
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

My Heoku Site is [here](http://railsbbakertut.heroku.com/)

I had to redo for some reason with heroku I messed up the whole repository and couldn't figure it out so I started from scratch and it worked.
